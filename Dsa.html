                        <p class="about__text">A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.</p> <br>
                        <h3>Arrays</h3>
                        <p>The array is a data structure used to store homogeneous elements at contiguous locations. The size of an array must be provided before storing data. </p><br>
                        <h3>Linked List</h3>
                        <p>A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object. Each element (that is node) of a list is comprised of two items – the data and a reference to the next node. <br><br>

                            Types of Linked List : <br> 
                          <h5>1. Singly Linked List</h5>  In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of the next node in the list and the last node has the next address or reference as NULL. For example 1->2->3->4->NULL <br> <br>
                          <h5>2. Doubly Linked List</h5> In this type of Linked list, there are two references associated with each node, One of the reference points to the next node and one to the previous node. The advantage of this data structure is that we can traverse in both directions and for deletion, we don’t need to have explicit access to the previous node. Eg. NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL <br><br>
                          <h5>Circular Linked List</h5> Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or a doubly circular linked list. The advantage of this data structure is that any node can be made as starting node. This is useful in the implementation of the circular queues in the linked list. Eg. 1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of the last node is pointing to the first]  <br> <br>
                        <h3>Stack</h3>
                        <p>A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the last element that was added. In stack both the operations of push and pop take place at the same end that is top of the stack. It can be implemented by using both array and linked list. <br>Example: Stacks are used for maintaining function calls (the last called function must finish execution first), we can always remove recursion with the help of stacks. Stacks are also used in cases where we have to reverse a word, check for balanced parenthesis, and in editors where the word you typed the last is the first to be removed when you use undo operation. Similarly, to implement back functionality in web browsers.  </p> <br>
                        <h3>Queue</h3>
                        <p>A queue or FIFO (first in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: enqueue, the process of adding an element to the collection. (The element is added from the rear side) and dequeue the process of removing the first element that was added. (The element is removed from the front side). It can be implemented by using both array and linked list. <br> Example: Queue as the name says is the data structure built according to the queues of a bus stop or train where the person who is standing in the front of the queue(standing for the longest time) is the first one to get the ticket. So any situation where resources are shared among multiple users and served on a first come first serve basis. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. Another application of queue is when data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at the same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc. <br> </p>
